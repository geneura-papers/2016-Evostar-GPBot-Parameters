OPTabstract = {An algorithm that returns as low-cost solutions as possible at any moment of its execution is said to have a good anytime behaviour. The problem of optimising anytime behaviour can be modelled as a bi-objective non-dominated front, where the goal is to minimise both time and cost. Using a unary quality measure such as the hypervolume indicator, the analysis of the anytime behaviour can be converted into a single-objective problem. In this manner, available automatic configuration tools can be applied to improve the anytime behaviour of an algorithm. If we want to optimise the anytime behaviour of multi-objective algorithms, we may apply again unary quality measures to obtain a scalar value for measuring the obtained approximation to the Pareto front. Thus, for multi-objective algorithms, the anytime behaviour may be described in terms of the curve of the hypervolume over time, and the quality of this bi-objective tradeoff curve be evaluated according to its hypervolume. Using this approach, we can automatically improve the anytime behaviour of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In this article, we first introduce this approach and then experimentally study the improvements obtained considering three MOEAs, namely, IBEA, NSGA-II and SPEA2.},

OPTabstract = {Heuristic search algorithms (MOA*, NAMOA* etc) for multiobjective optimization problems, when run with admissible heuristics, typically spend a lot of time and require huge amount of memory for generating the Pareto optimal solution frontier due to the fact that these algorithms expand all nodes/paths whose cost is not dominated by any other optimal solution. In this paper, we present an anytime heuristic search framework for biobjective optimization problems named “Anytime Biobjective Search (ABS)” which quickly finds a set of nondominated solutions and keeps on improving the solution frontier with time. The proposed framework uses the upper and lower limit estimates on one of the objectives to split the search space into a given number of segments and independently runs a particular search algorithm (branch-and-bound, beam search etc.) within each of the segments. In this paper, we present how existing search strategies, branch-and-bound, beam, and beam-stack, can be used within the proposed framework. Experimental results reveal that our proposed framework achieves good anytime performance.},

Results show that in average, the bots obtained using our method equal or outperform the previous ones, being the maximum depth of the tree a relevant parameter for the algorithm.},

OPTabstract = {This paper investigates the performance and the results of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) specifically designed for evolving the decision engine of a program (which, in this context, is called bot) that plays Planet Wars. This game, which was chosen for the Google Artificial Intelligence Challenge in 2010, requires the bot to deal with multiple target planets, while achieving a certain degree of adaptability in order to defeat different opponents in different scenarios. The decision engine of the bot is initially based on a set of rules that have been defined after an empirical study, and a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for tuning the set of constants, weights and probabilities that those rules include, and therefore, the general behaviour of the bot. Then, the bot is supplied with the evolved decision engine and the results obtained when competing with other bots (a bot offered by Google as a sparring partner, and a scripted bot with a pre-established behaviour) are thoroughly analysed. The evaluation of the candidate solutions is based on the result of non-deterministic battles (and environmental interactions) against other bots, whose outcome depends on random draws as well as on the opponents’ actions. Therefore, the proposed GA is dealing with a noisy fitness function. After analysing the effects of the noisy fitness, we conclude that tackling randomness via repeated combats and reevaluations reduces this effect and makes the GA a highly valuable approach for solving this problem.},

OPTabstract = {This paper presents an analysis of evolved strategies for an abstract real-time strategy (RTS) game. The abstract RTS game used is a turn-based strategy game with properties such as parallel turns and imperfect spatial information. The automated player used to learn strategies uses a progressive refinement planning technique to plan its next immediate turn during the game. We describe two types of spatial tactical coordination which we posit are important in the game and define measures for both. A set of ten strategies evolved in a single environment are compared to a second set of ten strategies evolved across a set of environments. The robustness of all of evolved strategies are assessed when playing each other in each environment. Also, the levels of coordination present in both sets of strategies are measured and compared. We wish to show that evolving across multiple spatial environments is necessary to evolve robustness into our strategies.},

In this regard, there have been many researchers to find the optimized choice. This paper confirms the improvement of NPC performance in a real-time strategy game by using the speciated evolutionary algorithm for such decision making on actions, which has been largely applied to the classification problems. Creation and selection of members to use for this ensemble method is manifested through speciation and the performance is verified through `conqueror', a real-time strategy game platform developed by our previous work.},
